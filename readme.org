* TextGrad jQuery plugin
  A plugin to make color gradients in texts.

** "Don't you think it's a silly plugin you have written ?"
   No I don't /think/ so, I am bloody *sure* of it.
** "Are you not ashamed of the quality of the code ?"
   Oh yes I am. It was my first program in javascript, meaning one of
   my first programs at all. Very nasty. Still, some people seem to
   use it, so I'm trying to maintain it when I have bug-fix emails
   from very kind people.

* Doc / Example
  clone the repo and open the test/test.htm file in a browser.
